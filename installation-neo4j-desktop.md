# Installation of ‚ÄúNeo4j Desktop‚Äù on Ubuntu 

## 1. Installing Neo4j Desktop

Visit on the Neo4j download website https://neo4j.com/download/

![download-desktop-page-1](./images/download-desktop-page-1.webp)


When you click on the Download button, you will get a screen to register yourself to receive the activation key for Neo4j Desktop as below:
![download-desktop-page-2](./images/download-desktop-page-2.webp)

When you click on the download button, a new screen will appear that will contain the key as shown below and the downloading will start.


![download-desktop-activation-key](./images/download-desktop-activation-key.webp)


Copy and keep the `Activation Key` at a safe location that we will use for software registration step.

Go the directory where installation file `.AppImage` is downloaded, and execute the following command

```bash
chmod +x neo4j-desktop-1.5.9-x86_64.AppImage
```


```bash
./neo4j-desktop-1.5.9-x86_64.AppImage  
```

If you get the error like below:

```bash
dlopen(): error loading libfuse.so.2

AppImages require FUSE to run. 
You might still be able to extract the contents of this AppImage 
if you run it with the --appimage-extract option. 
See https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE 
for more information
```
Then run the following commands:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

After that you can execute again the command
```bash
./neo4j-desktop-1.5.9-x86_64.AppImage
```

And you will see the output similar to following:

```bash
